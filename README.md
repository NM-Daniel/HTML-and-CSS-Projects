# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository is a collection of challenges and sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.
<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="./Basic_HTML_Website_Project/index.html">Treehouse Site</a></li>
  <li><a href="./bootstrap4_project/nautilus_dives.html">Dive Company Site</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Treehouse Site</h3>
This page is an example of a home page for a website that specializes in building custom treehouses. It contains a fixed navbar, background image, images containers, and a contact form.
<h3>Dive Company Site</h3>
This is an example website page I made with Bootstrap 4. It uses many Bootstrap elements such as a navbar, a jumbotron, columns, image cards, and a search bar.
